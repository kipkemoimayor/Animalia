    <h2 align="center">The stupid dog aka:<em>Animalia</em></h2>
    <p>Animalia is a lucky dog here is a story of how it came to be </p>
    <p>I found Animalia at a parking lot near Nairobi national park, It was woonded and homeless its was a little puupy and its
    wounds were from an eagle bite, It looked streesed with no joy</p>
    <p>But it all changed when animalia finally got to have a home</p>
    <p>To keep Animalia happy here are some things of joy</p>
    <ul>
      <li>bath it most often</li>
      <li>feed it with beef</li>
      <li>give it time to stroll around the park</li>
      <li>give it time to interact with other dogs</li>
      <li>swim,aiT LOVES water like a buttefliy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Oh, did i forget to say Animalia is 5 Years old</p>
